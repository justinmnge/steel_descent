Take command of a lone vessel in this arcade-style naval combat game. Surrounded by endless ocean, you'll face wave after wave of enemy ships with just one goal: to survive as long as you can while racking up the highest score possible. Each enemy vessel you destroy adds to your total, but be careful â€“ the seas grow increasingly dangerous the longer you survive.

Every session is a fresh start and a new chance to beat your personal best. Compare your greatest victories against previous attempts on the local leaderboard, which tracks your highest scores and the dates they were achieved.
